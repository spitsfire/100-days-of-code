# 100 Days Of Code - Battle Log

### Round 1: February 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Re-organized fork of 100 Days of Code repo, created my first #100DaysOfCode tweet, and have started rotating through my courses on Udemy, Treehouse, and Free Code Camp. Currently, I'm reviewing HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** While I frequently study and write code, it will be a challenge for me to create a consistent log of my daily challenge.

### Round 2: February 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created a simple program that asks user to input a city name, and the program will output the correct area code. I also reviewed more HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** I knew where I should be going with the code, but it soon got unwieldy. I had to run through the tutorial on udemy to figure out where I was overcomplicating the methods I was trying to define.
